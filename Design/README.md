Athens Car Rental is a car renting firm that needs a database from scratch. It has a car fleet in different regions of Athens which rents B2C or B2B. It needs the database to store important information about its cars, its customers, branches, rentals and payments.

Using SQL Server, we firstly analysed the basic information needed to operate such a business in a simple way and created a map of the Tables needed on draw.io, diagram matrices and the Relational Models. Then we created the tables and inserted some information for testing.

The above Project was designed and implemented by Lattas Alexander and Fotis Katsigiannis with the guidance of the Professor Mr. Damianos Chatziantoniou.
